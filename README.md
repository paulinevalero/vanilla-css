You can find [the complete Figma file here](https://www.figma.com/file/hCpxiFZcw0TQ4MjFipku2P/Styles-Test?node-id=1%3A2).

You will need to inspect the file to get the font and link it from the Google Fonts CDN, as well as to get the colors and sizes of each element.

## Starting the test

1. Fork this repo
2. Download the project
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`
4. Start the project with `yarn start`

#### You should now have a live server running on [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/) âœ¨

## Tips

- Use flexbox or grid for the layout.
- A basic **SASS** configuration is included, so, go ahead and nest your styles!
- Remember the correct semantic tags for each part, but don't overthink it too much.

## Deliverable

You have until **October 14th** to make a pull request like we used to a year ago ðŸ¥º
